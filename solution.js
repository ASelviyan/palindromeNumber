//PROBLEM
// Given a integer you'll have to figure out if the number is a palindrome number
// you'll know that its a Palindrome number if the number is the same if its read the same forwards and backwards 

//if number is smaller then 0 return false 
// number will be made into a string
// make the number that is given into an array 
// The number will me push out of the array and be put into a variable
//after the whole loop is finished check the reverse variable to the variable that was given to see if they are the same and then return true 
//else they don't match return false

//CONSTRAINTS
//the number that is given to us is more then or equal to -2^31 and is smaller then adn equal to 2^31 - 1
